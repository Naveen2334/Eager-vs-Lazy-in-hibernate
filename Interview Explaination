FetchType.EAGER is generally not recommended for production environments. It can be useful during development, testing, or proof of concept (PoC) scenarios, but it's not advisable for production use. Why? Let me give you an example.

Imagine you have 1,000 posts in your post table. Each post has 100 comments. Now, if you load the post table with FetchType.EAGER, it will not only fetch the posts but also fetch all associated comments eagerly. That means 1,000 posts × 100 comments = 100,000 comments loaded into memory — whether you need them or not. This unnecessary data loading severely impacts the performance of the application.

When you fetch the post, all its associated comments are fetched automatically, regardless of whether you use them. This leads to memory consumption, high processing time, and possible application slowness or crashes in large-scale systems.

So, why do some developers use EAGER? Because during the development phase, using FetchType.EAGER reduces boilerplate code, simplifies testing, and makes it easier to see the related data without writing extra queries. For small applications, prototypes, or proof of concepts, it's perfectly fine to use. It saves development time and simplifies the design temporarily.

But for production-grade applications, EAGER fetching is risky. You should use LAZY loading combined with techniques like JPQL JOIN FETCH or @EntityGraph to control fetching only when needed. This approach ensures better performance, optimal memory usage, and scalability.

In summary, use EAGER in development, testing, or PoC when performance is not a concern. But in production, avoid EAGER; it leads to unnecessary data fetching and degrades application performance."

⭐ Clean, One-Liner Summary (Closing Punch):
"FetchType.EAGER is fine for development, testing, or proof of concept, but never recommended for production because it loads all related entities into memory unnecessarily, which can crash performance as data grows."
