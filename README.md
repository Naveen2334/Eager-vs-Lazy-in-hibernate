üöÄ Eager vs Lazy in Hibernate ‚Äî Top Interview Questions
‚úÖ 1. What is Lazy Loading in Hibernate?
Answer:
Lazy loading means related entities are not fetched from the database until they are accessed for the first time. Hibernate creates a proxy object initially and fires the SQL query only when the getter method of the related entity is called.

‚úÖ 2. What is Eager Loading in Hibernate?
Answer:
Eager loading means related entities are fetched immediately along with the main entity, even if they are not accessed. Hibernate loads the association as part of the initial select query.

‚úÖ 3. What is the default Fetch Type in Hibernate?
Answer:

For @OneToMany and @ManyToMany, the default is Lazy.

For @ManyToOne and @OneToOne, the default is Eager.

‚úÖ 4. How to change the fetch type in Hibernate?
Answer:
By using the fetch attribute in the annotation:

java
Copy
Edit
@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)  
private List<Comment> comments;
‚úÖ 5. Why is FetchType.EAGER not recommended in production?
Answer:
Eager loads all associated entities whether needed or not. For example, if a Post has 1000 comments and 1000 posts are fetched, it loads 100,000 comments unnecessarily. This increases memory consumption, degrades performance, and can lead to application crashes.

‚úÖ 6. What is LazyInitializationException?
Answer:
When an entity is lazily loaded but the Hibernate session is already closed when its getter is accessed, Hibernate cannot fetch the data and throws LazyInitializationException.

‚úÖ 7. How do you handle LazyInitializationException?
Answer:

Use @Transactional to keep the session open.

Fetch data eagerly via JPQL with JOIN FETCH.

Use @EntityGraph in Spring Data JPA for dynamic eager fetching.

‚úÖ 8. How does SQL differ between Lazy and Eager fetching?
Answer:

Lazy: Fires multiple queries ‚Äî one for parent and separate for each child when accessed.

Eager: Fires a join query or multiple selects immediately.

‚úÖ 9. How to perform eager loading without FetchType.EAGER in entity?
Answer:
Using JPQL:

java
Copy
Edit
@Query("SELECT p FROM Post p JOIN FETCH p.comments WHERE p.id = :id")  
Post findPostWithComments(@Param("id") Long id);
Or with Spring Data:

java
Copy
Edit
@EntityGraph(attributePaths = "comments")  
Post findById(Long id);
‚úÖ 10. Which is better: Eager or Lazy?
Answer:
Lazy is preferred because it avoids unnecessary loading and improves performance. Eager should be used only when the related entities are always needed together.

üî• ‚≠ê Bonus Question (Advanced)
‚úÖ 11. Can Lazy loading be applied on @ManyToOne?
Answer:
Yes. Though the default for @ManyToOne is Eager, you can override it to Lazy like this:

java
Copy
Edit
@ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)  
private Post post;
